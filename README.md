CS-210: Module 8 Assignment: Journal
Prof. Brian Morgan

Project Summarization:

As junior developers for Chada Tech, we are given the task to create a program for Corner Grocer. This program needs to analyze the text records Corner Grocer generates throughout the day, and output a file with the frequency in which items are purchased.

Program (Problem Solution):

The project created is an item-tracking program for Corner Grocer, with the ability to analyze an item's frequency and output this frequency, in a new file, as a word with the number of times it appears.

What did you do particularly well?

For this project, I feel I did well with classes, functions, and loops. For me, C++ was a complex programming language to learn and work with. After this course, I will continue to work hard in order to understand the language better and improve all my C++ projects.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

The code could be enhanced further by using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (continuously) and providing more detailed comments. By improving the code, I am making it cleaner, and also easier to understand, which can benefit future developers. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part of this project was writing from one file to another usign a hash map. Using the resources provided by the professor and SNHU, as well as my boyfriend's help, I was able to overcome the roadblock I had with the hash map. After this project, I am planning to add tools such as freeCodeCamp, LeetCode, and W3Schools to my support network. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and organizational skills.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

By providing comments, grouping things into classes and functions, and separating things into different files I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
