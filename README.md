Project Summarization:

As junior developers for Chada Tech, we are given the task to create a program for Corner Grocer. This program needs to analyze the text records Corner Grocer generates throughout the day, and output a file with the frequency in which items are purchased.

Program (Problem Solution):

The project created is an item-tracking program for Corner Grocer, with the ability to analyze an item's frequency and output this frequency, in a new file, as a word with the number of times it appears.
